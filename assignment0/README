From a terminal:

1) sudo apt-get update

-This will update your apt database to the most recent available packages.

2) sudo apt-get install build-essential

- This installs the necessary development tools for building source code.

3) sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

- This installs the development libraries and headers for freeglut.

4) cd Assignment 0

- change directory into Assignment0 folder

5) g++ main.cpp -o a0 -lGL -lGLU -lglut -Ivecmath

- compile

6) ./a0

- run `a0`


Please ensure your code compiles on VS2010 after development. 
You can try on the computers in the digital systems lab.
Treat it as a learning experience to compile C++ across platforms.

For the basic stuff, it's almost copy and paste.
But if you try some extra credit (e.g. Vertex Buffer Objects),
there may be more work to be done to ensure it compiles on windows.
